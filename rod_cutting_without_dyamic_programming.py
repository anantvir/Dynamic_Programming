"""Highly inefficient exponential time solution for rod cutting problem"""

# If we draw the recursion tree for n = 4 as shown pn page 364 CLRS, we see that same function
# is called multiple times example Cut_Rod(P,2) is called 2 times and Cut_Rod(P,1) is called
# 4 times. All these repeated calls result in exponential time because all 2^n-1 combinations
# are tried to get the best possible revenue. If we store the values of Cut_Rod(P,2) and Cut_Rod(P,1)
# we can avoid these repeated calls. We can instead check for these values in the storage array.
# If they already exist, then just pick value from that array instead of making a new recursive call
# This technique is called memoization. It has been implemented in next program which reduces time from 
# exponential to polynomial
